		    <p><b>Instrumental</b> music tends to be the most<strong> difficult</strong> to name. Without a concrete topic of <i><b>what</b></i> the piece is about (which lyrics would provide), it’s hard to choose an appropriate name. Such pieces are often named with a suggestive phrase. </p>

		      <p>However, by the Romantic era (from about 1780 to 1910) composers used them as titles for standalone works as well (except for the finale which is always the last movement of a larger piece). Popular examples include the sets of preludes by Debussy, Chopin and Rachmaninov as well as sets of intermezzi by Brahms.

              In popular genres, it’s not uncommon to have songs titled with ‘Parts’. A famous example is Pink Floyd’s ‘Shine on You Crazy Diamond’ with 9 parts split into two and named “Part I-V” and “Part VI-IX”.

			     Deep into that darkness peering,

                 Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,

                 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals

                 Ever dared to dream before;

                 But the silence was unbroken,

                 And the stillness gave no token,

                 And the only word there spoken

                 Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"

                 his I whispered, and an echo

                 Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"

                 Merely this, and nothing more.
